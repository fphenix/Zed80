# Zed80

AmstradCPC (446/6128) and Z80 Emulator in Processing!

Work very much in progress.

Right now it's ("only" vs. "already") capable to run the loader screen of the game "Head Over Heels" (by Ocean), read from a diskette image (.dsk file). The picture is a beautiful 8-bit art by F. David Thorpe, which already makes this project worth it!

It could be even faster (although it used to be much much slower (loading screen 10sec now vs. 2h before!))!

Not all Z80 Opcodes/Instructions are implemented yet.

Not all System vector calls are implemented yet.

Keyboard not yet implement.

Firmware and ROM only implemented via the few vector call already in.

Sound not yet supported.

For educational purposes only.

Note: I am nowhere near a Software/Java.Processing expert. I'd be glad to get any inputs.
