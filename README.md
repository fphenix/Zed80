# Zed80

AmstradCPC (464/6128) and Z80 Emulator in Processing!

Work very much in progress.

Right now it's ("only" vs. "already") capable to run the loader screen of the game "Head Over Heels" (by Ocean), read from a diskette image (.dsk file). 
The picture is a beautiful 8-bit art by F. David Thorpe, which already makes this project worth it!
It then loads the game menu.

The frame rate needs to be adjust.

All Z80 Opcodes/Instructions are implemented, but not all have been fully tested yet.

Keyboard not yet implemented (this is the next step, as the game menu now waits for user input).

Sound not yet supported.

For educational purposes only.

Note: I am nowhere near a Software/Java.Processing expert. I'd be glad to get any inputs.
